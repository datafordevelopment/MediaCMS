# MediaCMS

MediaCMS is a media publishing website, enabling media owners to sell images, photos, videos and audio files.

This is a fairly large Ruby on Rails application which includes the following features:

* Background worker to convert uploaded images/ videos and audio files into correct formats. This includes: generating preview tiles and watermarking
* Color based navigation: Uploaded images pass through a color histogram algorithm that indexes it by ita mostly used colors. This suggests other images that match the currently viewed image
* E-Commerce facilities that allow site members to sell uploaded images/videos/audios and the site operator to charge a set commissions. Current merchant processors include Paypal and WorldPay
* Extensive commenting against each media file with spam filtering
* Club facility to allow club members to create public/private clubs that can also host their own public/private forums
* Geotagging
* Skinable

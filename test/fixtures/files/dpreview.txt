<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://a.img-dpreview.com/news/0809/kodak_ccd.gif" width="100" height="47" hspace="8" align="right"">]]>Bryce Bayer, inventor of the color filter array used to determine color in virtually every modern digital camera has been given the UK Royal Photographic Society&apos;s Progress Award. Commonly known as the Bayer filter or Bayer pattern, his invention of a pattern of red, green and blue filters allows a light (but not color) sensitive sensor to record a broad range of colors in similar proportions to the sensitivity of the human eye. The work, conducted while working for Kodak, was patented in 1975 and originally described a system intended for recording video.</description>

By adding 720p HD video recording with contrast-detection AF and upping the continuous shooting rate to 7 frames per second, Nikon has made only subtle changes for its latest flagship APS-C DSLR, the D300S. However, its predecessor was an excellent camera and one that has proven hard to beat. So, has Nikon done enough to face up to Canon&apos;s rather impressive EOS 7D? Read our 30 page review to find out.</description>

Our lens review of the Canon EF 100mm F2.8 L IS USM. A few months ago Canon announced a new optical image stabilisation technology, dubbed &apos;Hybrid IS&apos;, that promises greater effectiveness at close distances for which conventional IS systems tend to be ineffective. The first lens to feature this has duly arrived in the shape of Canon&apos;s latest 100mm Macro, which alongside image stabilisation has also gained the added attraction of the premium &apos;L&apos; designation. We take a close look to see if it&apos;s worth the premium over the older EF 100mm F2.8 USM Macro, which remains in Canon&apos;s range.</description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://a.img-dpreview.com/reviews/images/ricoh_gxr_s10.gif" width="120" height="83" hspace="8" align="right"">]]>After several weeks of rumors Ricoh has unveiled its first digital system camera, the GRX. The system takes a novel approach by offering interchangeable slide mount &apos;lens units&apos; - sealed modules containing both optics and sensor, meaning it can switch from a large (APS-C) 12 MP CMOS with a fast prime lens to a tiny 10 MP CCD (with a 24-70mm lens). We&apos;ve had a pre-production GXR system in the office for a week and have produced an in-depth hands-on preview which you&apos;ll find after the link. We&apos;ve also taken lots of pictures with both lens modules so look out a little later today for an extensive gallery of samples.</description>

A statement from the company corrects an earlier press release from online shopping specialist Digital River about an online store that will be established before the end of the year.
